`print`!
========

what does it do?

the >>> job is to hand us back a value so it prints almost everything

but later on when we want to put this into a script and not run 
it from repl, we will want to see our results. We need some way
to tell python, hand back the result to the screen.

print in 2 `print`
print in 3 `print()`
